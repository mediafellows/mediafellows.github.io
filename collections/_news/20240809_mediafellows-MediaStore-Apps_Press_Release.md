        <strong><big>New Custom App Features</big></strong>         
      </p>
       <p>
        mediafellows has developed fully custom apps for clients like <a target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/itv-studios-watch-anywhere/id1637023534">ITV Studios</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/lgtv-screeners/id6471593083">Lionsgate</a>, and <a target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/eone-preview/id6443721624">eOne</a>, all available under native branding in the App Store. We continuously introduce new and innovative features to ensure these apps remain cutting-edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed first and foremost as the ultimate portable sales aid, much of the latest mobile app functionality is geared towards seamless market use and smooth presentations. Custom MediaStore apps are used frequently at international expositions and integrated into market booths and stands at industry events.

        <strong>Presentation Mode</strong> switches seamlessly to a modified interface designed specifically for sales pitches and works seamlessly with our second-screen connectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Custom Collections</strong> can now be centrally assembled for offline synchronization, saving sales agents hours of prep work, and once downloaded integrate seamlessly into a browsable catalog even when the device is not connected. Collections are newly compatible with multiple file types including slides, PDFs, and sales sheets for comprehensive multimedia presentations. Clients have already noted the boost in the sales process achieved by being able to attach a sales deck to every kind of presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our unique <strong>Meeting Manager</strong> feature, successfully used by ITV Studios for over a year, is now being rolled out to more clients with custom MediaStore apps to assist with team organization and scheduling events.

        Design and content display has been a particular focus of innovation, with seamless transition between the UI of our MediaStore client sites and their corresponding apps. <strong>Picture-in-Picture (PiP)</strong> is now available on request, enhancing content display and multitasking capabilities. Additional design features on screener previews, such as BBFC ratings and color badges for special product access, have been implemented for clear labeling.         
      </p>
       <p>
        Search and display have been enhanced with new language filters (such as dubbed, burned-in, multilingual), and series metadata and new sub-genres are now shown, providing more comprehensive detail. We also offer <strong>2FA</strong> on request to comply with our clients’ security guidelines.

        <strong><big>What's New in the MediaStore App</big></strong>        
      </p>
      <p>
        Get access to a host of portable sales features without the design and launch of a full custom app by using the MediaStore App, <a target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mediastore-generic-app/id1643153142">available in the App Store</a> to registered users.
      </p>
       <p>
        New features for our generic app include the implementation of <strong>deep links</strong> on all pages to direct users to the most relevant content, and <strong>proactive revalidation</strong> of content. For security reasons, downloaded offline content has a limited validity period  — with proactive content renewal, however, users can restore downloads in advance and in bulk, eliminating the risk of losing offline access in critical situations.
