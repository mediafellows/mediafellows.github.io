This was made possible through advanced integrations with Lionsgate's existing metadata and asset repositories, allowing for most catalog data to be auto-populated in bulk. In addition, a custom-built tool seamlessly syncs assets between LGTV's existing MediaStore account and the new Motion Picture Group system. MediaStore’s dynamic, title-based pricing will allow Lionsgate to continue growing their catalog flexibly as they consolidate content from multiple sources.

   <strong><big>Apps for every major platform.</big></strong>   
      </p>
      <p>
		mediafellows was ideally suited to support the cross-platform app launch, having previously released and published apps for Lionsgate’s TV division.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Cutting-edge features to enhance usability have been developed for this project, including a new <strong>login activation</strong> flow for TV. Similar to on-demand streaming services, users can scan a <strong>QR code</strong> with their mobile devices to validate their MediaStore accounts on the new TV apps, for a seamless transition between web, mobile, and TV.
      </p>
      <p>
		Improvements to the video player, such as a fast-forward option to streamline review for Lionsgate’s external ratings board submissions, will also be rolled out to all MediaStore clients.

      Additional functionality custom-built for Lionsgate has been integrated into the standard MediaStore feature suite, including timezone scheduling for recommendations, automatic localization of date and time formats, and a new <strong>vendor access role</strong> for secure third-party content uploads. This role allows vendors to upload content without accessing or editing other Admin UI data. Uploaded content is automatically assigned a <strong>review status</strong>, which cannot be modified by the vendor, enabling Lionsgate admins to filter and approve submissions easily and efficiently.
