mediafellows software and technology operates directly from the cloud and allows content owners to either outsource or self-manage and internally control their content within their instance of the platform. Content owners can also grant selective access permissions to third parties, so that supply chain providers, such as creative or localization vendors, can ingest finished assets directly into the platform. Access can also be granted to potential content buyers or licensees enabling the ability to securely screen features or series online. Once the content sales process concludes, licensed titles and related promotional material—such as key art, trailers, ancillary assets, and metadata are processed according to the specification requirements and electronically delivered to the licensee or offered for self-service download.
