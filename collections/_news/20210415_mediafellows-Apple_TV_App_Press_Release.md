Discovery via highlighted titles, genres and a text search makes it easy to find a title or show of interest and enjoy a cinematic viewing experience based on our secure video streaming service. Several features driving user-specific engagement, such as received content recommendations and favorites, are available in the app as well.

<strong>Torsten Graf-Oettel</strong>, mediafellows' Managing Director: <i>"The days when watching films and series was confined to a single device or physical medium are long gone, and with the proliferation of device-agnostic streaming services, not only consumers but also content buyers expect an efficient and well-designed screening experience. Our new Apple TV app distills the muscle of the MediaStore system into a visually rich essence which focuses squarely on content and streaming, while branding options allow our clients to make it 100% their own as well."</i>

The newly launched app is a white-label version offered to all content owners and distributors using MediaStore, as well as their clients. Once you are logged in, the app will populate itself with content from the MediaStore website you entered as a domain upon login. Customized versions of the app, including an App Store deployment under your own brand, are available upon request.
