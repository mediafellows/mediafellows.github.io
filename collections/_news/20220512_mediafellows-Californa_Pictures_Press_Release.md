Originally founded in 1944, California Pictures was reincorporated in 2008 by Steven Istock and was based at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles for five years. The company has amassed a boutique catalog comprising a broad range of powerful themes and strong characters, which its dynamic sales team distributes worldwide and presents at major markets and festivals around the globe. In addition, California Pictures acts as an advisor to producers on topics from casting and distributor interests to budgeting and cash flow.
          </p>
          <p>
Facing the opportunities of a broadening distribution catalog and the desire to curb technical and administrative overhead while delivering a state-of-the-art screening experience to buyers and partners, California Pictures is choosing to leverage MediaStore's white-label solution, a sales and distribution platform which can be set up, configured and populated within weeks.
          </p>

<strong>Steven Istock</strong>, California Pictures CEO & President, comments: <i>"Our aim in spring of 2022 was not only a sales & marketing platform, but also a fully fledged new web presence for our company - ideally in time for Cannes Film Festival in May. With mediafellows, we were able to achieve this goal and are delighted that we can already rely on our new website as we travel to Cannes."</i>
          </p>
          <p>
mediafellows project manager <strong>Stefan Hauschildt</strong> adds: <i>"With our white-label platform, we were able turn around a solution that could serve California Pictures and their clients very swiftly. Working closely together during the implementation period, we put together a compelling platform that lets California Pictures concentrate on presenting their catalog and making a strong showing with their sales efforts across the globe."</i>
