Officially launched in August, mediafellows worked closely with ITV Studios to bring their cutting-edge content to any screen, anywhere, with their new sales and marketing iPad app – <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/itv-studios-watch-anywhere/id1637023534" target="blank">available now in the App Store</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
With brand new features conceptualized by mediafellows like their in-built scheduling tool Meeting Manager, the sales workflow for MIPCOM was smoother than ever. Advanced filters and time-zone configuration made it easy to see which location was required by which ITV Studios hosts, and impossible to double-book.

In addition, the functionality extended far beyond a simple calendar tool to provide all presentation resources in one place. Sales agents compiled playlists of specific content in preparation for each meeting, adding relevant decks and PDFs, and then attached them all straight into their Meeting Manager bookings to pull up instantly on-site. Mobile synced collections allowed the sales team to download relevant content to stream offline, under any conditions, while simple point-and-click UX and screen mirroring made for intuitive playback and a polished client presentation.

Not only did the app features enhance the planning and delivery of the sales process, but they enabled more effective follow-ups with mediafellows’ Recommendations function; throughout meetings, sales agents could flag products of interest with one simple click, which they could review afterward and pursue by sending their clients a targeted view of all the products they ‘liked’.

mediafellows founder <strong>Torsten Graf-Oettel</strong> added, <i>“ITV Studios are always a pleasure to work with, and we were glad to be on-site to deliver support for our product – and even more glad that they didn’t need it!”</i>
