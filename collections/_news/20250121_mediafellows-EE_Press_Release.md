Needing an updated content sales platform, Electric Entertainment sought a full revamp — without the headache of hiring creative teams, long design discussions, or costly revisions. MediaStore’s turnkey solution provided the perfect answer, delivering a site ready to launch in record time — now available at <a href="https://sales.electricentertainment.com/" target="blank">sales.eletricentertainment.com</a>.

As with all their clients, mediafellows provided a bespoke solution by combining the cost savings and expediency of using their ready-to-go screening website format with custom elements.

For Electric Entertainment, they developed a dedicated market distribution listing with unique attribution fields for each product, indicating whether it is available for domestic, international, or worldwide distribution. This data is automatically compiled on a specialized listing page, making it easy for buyers to locate and browse the titles most relevant for them.

The MediaStore platform combines the efficiency of a template website alongside the benefits of dedicated account management. The mediafellows team even handled manual asset imports to ensure Electric Entertainment’s site and offline mobile app were ready in time to equip sales agents for winter markets.

With features like News pages, custom Collections, secure Content sharing, and dedicated Screening Rooms for featured content, the platform offers much more than video hosting. MediaStore’s granular access controls allow Electric Entertainment to operate a semi-public website — allowing basic information and trailers maximum exposure to the general public, while a subtle login wall protects rich content such as metadata, synopses, and full screeners.
