Engineered with both content buyers and sales executives in mind, our iOS app picks up the predominant features of MediaStore's customer-facing websites: An appealing landing page with highlighted titles and user-specific content, flexible search and navigation options, and, above all, best-in-class video screening via our secure multi-bitrate streaming architecture, which can easily be cast onto a larger screen. Furthermore, MediaStore's "Continue Watching" tracker allows users to alternate effortlessly between desktop and mobile, as view progress is relayed for all videos watched on all devices.
          </p>

Alongside these core features, the MediaStore iOS app provides comprehensive and secure offline screening capabilities. Content buyers can simply apply usage patterns well known from the OTT world, saving content for later offline screening directly within the app. Sales agents, in addition, have the option to precompile larger selections of content while using the regular MediaStore website and then synchronize these selections by pressing a single button in the app, e.g. for offline screening at upcoming film markets.

<strong>Torsten Graf-Oettel</strong>, mediafellows' Managing Director: comments: <i>"Content screening is no longer a stationary activity – we know this not only because of the rise of B2C streaming services in recent years but also because our industry clients have always been very mobile, be it because they are attending a film market, meeting a client or simply reviewing their newest productions while traveling. Our new iOS app lets them fully concentrate on their business while on the go, with a powerful purpose-built tool in their pocket that provides the same stunning usage experience of our websites while eliminating any technical or administrative hurdles."</i>
