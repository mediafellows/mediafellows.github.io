Each MIP event reaches a vast range of buyers, requiring flexibility and security for the screening platform that offers exclusive access to the newest global content. In response to these needs, mediafellows developed a bespoke solution in time for the MIPJUNIOR market in October of last year. Using a highly adaptive UX design with carefully managed user roles, mediafellows ensured that RX France had full administrative control, enabling buyers to view all content while exhibitors could access only their own uploads. Detailed analytics were available based on the respective user role. The solution allowed for monetized banners, reproduction of respective corporate IDs, links to each company’s line-up, custom metadata fields, and watermarking of sensitive content – for almost 170 exhibitors. 
          </p>
          <p>
The new screening platform of over 500 titles for MIPDOC takes the platform to the next level with improved functionalities and features derived from insights gleaned during the previous MIPJUNIOR event. These include improved feature availability based on each participant’s role and a solution to seamlessly update any content or user data throughout the event even after it has begun.
          </p>
          <p>
Visually, the design has been streamlined and made more compelling, with bright pops of color in actionable buttons and a cleaner, more focused homepage to drive home the quality of the content. Updates to the UX have been geared towards enabling the buyers to quickly find the content they’re looking for and bookmark suitable titles to return to later.
          </p>
          <p>
MediaStore’s flexible content structure made it possible to display and organize much more intricate and varied metadata than before, and its sophisticated search-and-discovery capabilities enable the users to easily navigate index and catalog pages. Extended filtering and sort functionality means buyers can filter by almost any parameter – for example, genre, duration, year of production, or available rights management territories. 
          </p>
          <p>
Both buyers and sellers can access the platform using their existing OneMIP accounts with a single sign-on. An array of new features have been added, including the ability to ‘favorite’ content of particular interest, create playlists, and even add notes to screeners to remind viewers of thoughts they had while watching. All of this information is recorded on a new report, which enables buyers to export data for future reference and share it with colleagues during or after the event. Meanwhile, sellers automatically receive daily reports, now sorted and aggregated more comprehensively for a fast and solid overview.

<strong>Polina Axenova, Product Owner at mediafellows</strong>, who managed both the MIPJUNIOR and MIPDOC projects:<br> <i>“For mediafellows, beginning the initial MIPJUNIOR project with RX France was brand new territory for us and a pilot of marketplace-style use of MediaStore.<br>
We are so happy to launch the next phase with the MIPDOC screening library and see the platform refined as our ambitions continue to grow for the next event!”</i>
          </p>
          <p>
