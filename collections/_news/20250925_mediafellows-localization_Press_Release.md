Until now, localization orders were managed offline — often requiring teams to cut and paste spreadsheets into emails for vendors. This fragmented process led to inefficiencies, delays, and risks in meeting deadlines, controlling localized asset versions, and managing dependencies.

By leveraging MediaStore’s <strong>Digital Asset Management (DAM)</strong> platform and Pixelogic’s expertise in localization processes, clients can now initiate localization requests directly within the system — reducing errors, saving time, and ensuring greater transparency across each step of the process.
          </p>
          <p>			  
An <strong>intuitive order wizard</strong> streamlines creation, allowing users to generate orders in just a few clicks: select a vendor, choose assets, define localization type (such as dubbing, subtitles, or artwork), specify target languages, and set due dates. Once submitted, orders are delivered electronically to the chosen vendor and continuously tracked through MediaStore, providing end-to-end visibility from request to processing to fulfillment.
          </p>
          <p>
The feature is fully <strong>vendor-agnostic</strong> and fits seamlessly into each MediaStore client’s workflow. Flexible import templates allow existing data (such as avail lists) to be uploaded directly into the MediaStore, reducing manual data entry to a minimum. A built-in dashboard provides real-time status updates, helping teams stay on top of progress without the need to chase emails or schedule status calls. Early adopters have already noted how much time and hassle they’ve saved across review, approvals and feedback loops.

<strong>Lucas Carboni</strong>, SVP of Supply Chain Technology at Pixelogic, commented:<br><i>“Developing this feature really shows what mediafellows and Pixelogic are capable of delivering together. By connecting MediaStore’s centralized workflows with Pixelogic’s localization supply chain, we’re helping studios and distributors gain efficiency, reduce communication overhead, and maintain the highest standards of security and quality.”</i>

<strong>Michael Prestage</strong>, mediafellows' SVP Business Development and project lead, added:<br><i>“We designed this localization order feature around our customers’ real workflows. Placing localization orders is simple, intuitive, and the new service was built to reduce touchpoints — teams can focus on delivering great content rather than managing spreadsheets and duplicating data across multiple systems.”</i>
