Professionals from the audiovisual sales and distribution industry will be well aware of the singular prestige of leading content markets organized by RX France, such as MIPTV and MIPCOM which are held in Cannes, France yearly. The digital platform is destined to become a compelling online complement to these events, offering content owners and distributors the opportunity to present their catalogues while utilizing the platform's self-servicing tools that give them unparalleled exposure to a wide global base of licensees all year round.

mediafellows and RX France devised a strategy in which the MediaStore will serve as backbone for hosting large, constantly evolving volumes of video assets. Furthermore, mediafellows' MediaStore will generate multi-bitrate video derivatives as well as provide secure streaming of the videos which can withstand peak traffic. The digital experience will be seamless: Content sellers' asset management tools, as well as buyer-oriented content discovery and screening, will be fully integrated into the OneMIP platform, while MediaStore's APIs will transparently provide the necessary interconnections to embed its leading video technology.

<strong>Torsten Graf-Oettel</strong>, mediafellows' Managing Director: remarks: <i>"While our MediaStore solution is widely used as a well-established standalone end-to-end solution for audiovisual marketing, sales, and distribution, we are equally happy to integrate it as a technological building block into dedicated partner solutions. Given MediaStore's APIs and scalable infrastructure, such integrations can be accomplished with ease. MediaStore's secure multi-bitrate video streaming engine in conjunction with its on-the-fly watermarking transcoding will be a great fit for OneMIP and we are excited to serve RX France and its global base of customers with our solution."</i>
