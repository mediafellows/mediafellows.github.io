            mediafellows is proud to announce the launch of the new, custom <a target="blank" href="https://redarrowstudiosinternational.com/">Red Arrow Studios International Sales and Marketing Website</a> with bold visuals and innovative user-centric features. 
          </p>
          <p>
            As a long-time client of mediafellows, Red Arrow Studios International commissioned us to build a modernized updated version of their screening website with the additional integration of corporate information and a news feed. mediafellows presented an offer in late 2022 for an entirely bespoke website re-design with the support of Paper Dog creative agency, with whom we have previously worked with on the Entertainment One Preview, among other projects.

The new website boasts a highly modern design with a strong visual focus, featuring vibrant images and bold colors in badges, headlines, and banners to draw attention to highlights and increase interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
As well as visual improvements, the redesign optimized the user journey with unrivaled search, filter and sorting options for a complex set of genre and sub-genre categories. New dedicated genre landing pages feature custom carousels of highlighted titles to really emphasize specific content Red Arrow Studios International chooses to drive to. In addition to genre groupings, adaptable themed Collections make it really easy for users to find content in different ways with creative multi-genre content pairings like ‘Female-Led Drama’ promoted on the homepage.
          </p>
          <p>
Key format Married at First Sight gets major exposure with a dedicated microsite which brings together all the different versions of the show and its spinoffs in a custom-designed destination.
          </p>
          <p>
The Red Arrow Studios International screening website has always had a large public component in which any user can browse their catalog, this is now supplemented by news content and corporate information. The addition of a subtle login wall on product pages drives sign-ups while preserving the site’s overall accessibility. Rich content, such as key metadata, synopses, streamable screeners and trailers, and previews of flyers and other documents, becomes available after log-in.
          </p>
          <p>
mediafellows developed two brand new features for this project: highlight points (where the team can add press quotes that stand out in their own bold section on the product page) and advanced PDF export (which immediately creates a PDF sales sheet for the title based on the metadata and key art at hand).            
          </p>
          <p>
Users can manage their own shortlists from the extensive product catalog with Favorites, and even Subscribe to a product for notifications when new videos are added. The visual overhaul project also fostered the perfect circumstances to migrate Red Arrow Studios International to the new state-of-the-art MediaStore admin UI with a comprehensive but seamless transition of data (including products, assets, existing users and passwords).            
          </p>          
          <p>
Launching just in time for MIPCOM 2023, mediafellows made sure to put focus on features like events promotion and mobile optimization to ensure the Red Arrow Studios International sales team was exceptionally well equipped for the market. The Events & Markets section, fully manageable in the admin UI, features custom visuals to promote upcoming events they are participating in. It includes product highlights and provides a convenient one-click button to download a multi-page PDF containing all key information. The super responsive mobile experience is significantly adjusted from the desktop layout to provide the best possible presentation, and full integration with the MediaStore white-label mobile app ensures the sales team can pre-load their devices with key content to take to showcase at MIPCOM – whatever the wifi.
