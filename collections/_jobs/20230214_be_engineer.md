  <li>work across teams with support, frontend, and design to achieve company-wide goals</li>
  <li>directly communicate with customers and other stakeholders to pinpoint feature requirements and solve their technical issues</li>
  <li>work on DevOps tasks and improve the way we all operate the services</li>
  <li>stand by to monitor real-time issues every now and then - this is a flexible schedule (roughly every 6 weeks) but we are flexible in changing on-call</li>
</ul>
</p>

  <li>experience with Postgres or another SQL database system</li>
