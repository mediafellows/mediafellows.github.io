text: "MediaStore's Video Screening Conference feature combines the traditional video conferencing functionality with the unique ability to stream promo and screener videos directly to participants, utilizing the platform's well-established and highly secure multi-bitrate video streaming engine. With this functionality, the platform provides those reliant on conferencing technology with an added value unique to MediaStore, resulting in a one-stop solution to remotely present exciting content to potential buyers in a compelling and technically frictionless manner."

subtext_1: "Users are able to prepare and schedule conferencing calls directly within the MediaStore platform, including compiling playlists of videos as well as inviting customers and prospects to the conference. During the meeting, the moderator can engage with participants face-to-face as well as share videos, which are streamed directly to participants via a front-and-center player at optimum quality."
subtext_2: "This eliminates the need for sharing videos via external links or relying on screen-sharing a video played on the moderator's device and transmitted with typically poor quality of 8 frames per second only. In addition, features such as waiting room, screen-sharing, text-based chat, panel and webinar layout, and enhanced moderator controls are available."
