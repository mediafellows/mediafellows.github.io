subtext_1: "Streamlining the creation of localization requests, our order wizard allows users to generate orders in just a few clicks: select a vendor, choose assets, define localization type (such as dubbing, subtitles, or artwork), specify target languages, and set due dates. Vendor-agnostic and compatible with existing workflows, MediaStore supports flexible import templates for uploading existing data and seamless collaboration with preferred vendors such as Pixelogic Media, Sony PCL, TransPerfect, and more."


subtitle_2: Tracking dashboard

subtext_2: "Once submitted, orders are delivered electronically and continuously tracked through a real-time dashboard, providing end-to-end visibility from request through fulfillment. Clear status updates and deadlines of all localization orders give you an easy to understand overview, reducing manual effort, errors, and delays. Third-party users can upload and update the tracker without accessing your secure files or full catalog due to our limited-view Vendor platform role, ensuring teams stay on top of progress without the need to chase emails or schedule status calls."
