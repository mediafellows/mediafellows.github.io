subtext_1: "You can review this data in a range of ways, including the MediaStore dashboard, weekly email reports, or delivered directly to your CRM or analytics tool. Review our one-stop dashboards for a glance at overall activity and the most viewed titles and videos, or dive into deep links to any object's dedicated analytics page in order to review activity more specifically - e.g. which titles a specific user viewed or who watched the most minutes of a specific screener." 
subtext_2: "Excel exports provide deeper insights, down to individual view traces, for further offline analysis and processing. Sign up for the platform's analytics reports for a weekly email summarizing key activity, including week-on-week trends. For a more specific view of activity made by clients who are allocated to a specific sales agent, a separate email report is available, as well as an optional spreadsheet attachment of video views segmenting clients by responsible sales agent. Integrate with your current CRM systems like Salesforce or third-party services like Google Analytics or Hotjar via our advanced APIs."
