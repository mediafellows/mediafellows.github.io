subtext_1: "Our client-facing app not only covers your sales usage but doubles as a fully-fledged VOD-style mobile solution for your clients, showcasing your catalog with a seamless one-tap UI. Use our generic turnkey apps to get started immediately, or opt for fully custom interfaces designed to your CI standards and deployed in the App Store under your own brand name.
Save videos to your device's offline storage individually or in bulk through precompiled mobile collections. Browsing is made effortless with intuitive Search and Favorites features, and sales agents can guide users to specific titles directly through the app with Recommendations. All content syncs seamlessly via HDMI or second-screen casting."
