text: "Our apps cover your sales presentations, giving you multiple marketing channels, and double as portable on-demand-style mobile solutions with second screen casting. While our platform can easily be accessed even with mobile devices, our dedicated mobile application is purpose-built for situations such as markets or sales pitches, where predefined content packages need to be presented seamlessly and internet connectivity is not guaranteed."

subtext_1: "Our client-facing app not only covers your sales usage but doubles as a fully-fledged VOD-style mobile solution for your clients, showcasing your catalog with a seamless one-tap UI. Use our generic turnkey app to get started immediately, or opt for a fully custom interface designed seamlessly with your CI and deployed in the App Store under your own brand name.
Save videos to your device's offline storage individually or in bulk through precompiled Collections. Browsing is made effortless with intuitive Search and Favorites features, and sales agents can guide users to specific titles directly through the app with Content Recommendations. All content syncs seamlessly with second-screen devices via HDMI or AirPlay."

Search and Favorites provide easy content discovery. Opt for an AppleTV+ App that allows users to explore your catalog in a visually rich format native to AppleTV+, featuring automatic playback of trailers and promos for immediate preview in the background."
