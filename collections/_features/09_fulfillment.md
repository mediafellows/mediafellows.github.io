text: "Host, review, and distribute your assets flexibly. MediaStore extends its functionality beyond sales and marketing by facilitating asset delivery to your licensees. Once your assets are hosted in MediaStore, distribution becomes effortless â€” eliminating the need to compile from scratch each time or reliance on external file transfer tools."

subtext_2: "Using our flexible access controls, you can grant timed access to specific clients, allowing them to retrieve assets from your catalog using various self-service download options such as ZIP package delivery and Aspera Faspex file transfer. Clients can easily browse, search, and filter assets with the same quality of presentation you expect from MediaStore. You can compile Collections or allow clients to show you which assets they need with fully flexible Wish Lists, Baskets and more. Additionally, you can send email-based download links directly from the platform to minimize their effort further."
