text: "With our Recommendations feature, one-click screening links with additional options (such as view restrictions, implicit access to embargoed content, 2FA validation) can be targeted to anyone – whether they’re already a user of the client platform or not. Trigger screening recommendations through various methods: choose a single title instantly, curate multiple titles for sending screening links with key art and product info, or send a direct link to a specific screener akin to video sharing platforms. Each recipient will get immediate access to their individual screening link via the email, or at any time in their logged-in client dashboard. Track everything from open-rates to link-clicks and view-time with our automated analytics. We ensure secure screening by applying validity period or view limits, sign-in-to-access restrictions, and visible watermarking – all adaptable on a case-by-case basis."

subtext_1: "Utilize the customized template for recommendation emails that we setup according to your corporate CI with your logo, color scheme and terminology. Alternatively, generate a direct link to embed in a current email thread."

subtitle_2: Recipient management
subtext_2: "Address large lists of recipients easily by precompiling recipient groups or pasting a comma-separated list of emails. Each recipient will receive an individual email with their own clicks and time limits – and no ability to see who else received the email. Optionally, integrate Recommendations into your current CRM so that your sales team can send links straight from that system."
